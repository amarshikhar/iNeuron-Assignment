    "Ans. If your data set is messy, building models will not help you to solve your problem. What will happen is “garbage in, garbage out.” In order to build a powerful machine learning algorithm. We need to explore and understand our data set before we define a predictive task and solve it. Quantitative research deals with numbers and statistics, while qualitative research deals with words and meanings. Quantitative methods allow you to systematically measure variables and test hypotheses. Qualitative methods allow you to explore concepts and experiences in more detail.\n"

    "Ans. In a scatterplot of bivariate data, we use the horizontal or \"x-axis\" for the explanatory variable and the vertical, or \"y-axis\" for the response variable. If there is a regression line on a scatter plot, you can identify outliers. An outlier for a scatter plot is the point or points that are farthest from the regression line. There is at least one outlier on a scatter plot in most cases, and there is usually only one outlier./\n"

It also shows how correlations change from one variable grouping to another."
