    "\n",
    "Ans. A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data. We divide out data into train and test data and use the train dataset to train our model."

    "\n",
    "Ans. K-fold cross-validation is defined as a method for estimating the performance of a model on unseen data. It is a technique used for hyperparameter tuning such that the model with the most optimal value of hyperparameters can be trained. It is a resampling technique without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-fold cross validation is implemented by randomly dividing the set of observations into k groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method is fit on the remaining k-1 folds."

    "Ans. A bootstrap sample is a smaller sample that is “bootstrapped” from a larger sample. Bootstrapping is a type of resampling where large numbers of smaller samples of the same size are repeatedly drawn, with replacement, from a single original sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of bootstrapping are that it is a straightforward way to derive the estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals, and it is convenient since it avoids the cost of repeating the experiment to get other groups of sampled data."

It is generally used to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does, and how it does it. The process is used by consumer-driven organizations to help them target their marketing and advertising efforts."
