    "Ans: Features are the basic building blocks of datasets. The quality of the features in your dataset has a major impact on the quality of the insights you will gain when you use that dataset for machine learning.\n",

You need great features that describe the structures inherent in your data. Better features means flexibility.\n",

So, every country can be represented as its distance from India in specified ranges like between 100-1000 will be category A, 1000-2000 category B and so on.\n",

In contrast, the filter methods pick up the intrinsic properties of the features (i.e., the “relevance” of the features) measured via univariate statistics instead of cross-validation performance.\n",
