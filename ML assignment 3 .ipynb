    "Ans. While it is undeniable that AI has opened up a wealth of promising opportunities, it has also led to the emergence of a mindset that can be best described as “AI solutionism”. This is the philosophy that, given enough data, machine learning algorithms can solve all of humanity's problems.\n",

For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc. \n",
